		<h2>A Night for Counting Stars</h2><br>
		<p>Autumn is full of the sky, as the season passes.<br>
             It seems that I can count all the stars in sky,<br>
             in autumn, without any worries.</p><br>
		<p>Why I can't count all the faint stars in my heart,<br>
			Because morning comes easily,<br>
			Because tomorrow night is only left,<br>
			It is because my youth is not yet over, truly.</p>
