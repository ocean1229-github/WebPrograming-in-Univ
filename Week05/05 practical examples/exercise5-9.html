	<h2>Aladdin</h2>
	<div id="p1"> <img src="poster.jpg">
		<p><em>If you imagine Aladdin in a videotape as a child, you are mistaken.</em><br>
		Aladdin, which has emerged as the hottest musical in New York, is Klook's first pick! <br>
		If you listen to the splendid stage directing of Disney Productions that you can't take your eyes off of 
		<br>and the familiar music that you've heard before, you'll fall in love with the performance in an instant.<br></p>
		<p>Aladdin, a musical that sings of infinite possibilities with one lamp and three wishes, is the best for everyone from adults to children.<br>
		A new song created for the musical by Oscar-winning composer Alan Menken also provides another level of enjoyment.</p>

	<div id="p2">Aladdin's performance runs until July 7, 2022.</div>
